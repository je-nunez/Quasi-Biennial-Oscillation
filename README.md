# Quasi-Biennial-Oscillation

Parsing the Quasi-Biennial-Oscillation time series. The description of the time series is in the
Freie Universit√§t Berlin at
[http://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/met/ag/strat/produkte/qbo/](http://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/met/ag/strat/produkte/qbo/)

This program parses only the Singapore data (the **singapore.dat** file) because the samples taken
in the Canton Island and at Gan in the Maldives Islands, which are present also at the above page,
have been closed for more than 40 years.

Furthermore, the **singapore.dat** input file is chosen because it is more detailed, it has measures
of the speed at the

      10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 hPascal

instead of only measures of the speed for

      10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70 hPascal

as in the other input files.

# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.
